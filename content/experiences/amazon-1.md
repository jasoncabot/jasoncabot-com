Developed Amazon Music for the FireTV platform.

Successfully developed the single, global Amazon Instant Video for iOS application in order support the migration of users from the legacy LOVEFiLM streaming video apps in the UK and Germany.

Co-ordinated with several global teams across multiple timezones to define and develop a solution for how to migrate existing customers of the LOVEFiLM By Post mobile applications to the Amazon platform. I created a completely new set of applications to support the same set of functionality with a completely new service platform. The result was a seamless transition from the legacy LOVEFiLM to the new Amazon Instant Video platform for all existing LOVEFiLM By Post customers.
